#The client implementation also uses the "IFdHandler" interface 
and the "select" system call. Instead of an "EventSelector" 
object, a simple do while loop is used in the main function.

As elements for "select" lists, only two descriptors are used, 
one for the socket connected via TCP/IP with the server and 
one descriptor for stdin.

Thus, when entering, the "select" returns control, the virtual
function "VProcessing" is called, which processes the input
and sends it to the server.

Messages sent by the server are processed and output to the 
standard stream. It was decided to store the text of "help"
request on the client so as not to send 1kb of unchanged data
over the network.

Data processing is organized in the classical way - 
through a buffer, where data is read from one stream and 
from where it is output to another.

For system calls written wrappers, except of "send" and "recv", 
errors of which are handled separately.

There is nothing more interesting here:)
