# AvalonHillManager
@Management is a multiplayer game from Avalon Hill Company. The Management was offered by 
the Avalon Hill Company for training in the basics of enterprise management.

In my implementation, the game consists of two subprojects, a client and a server.
The client is quite simple, but the server is somewhat more complicated

Here is a description of the main concepts and architectural solutions.

Iâ€™ll note right away that the project code is not yet perfect, and perhaps never 
will be. Firstly because the underlying architecture in this case is highly dependent 
on the implementation of "select()" system call. Secondly, perhaps because I do not have
enough design experience.

Be that as it may, the project is implemented and is currently at the testing stage.

A detailed description of the project elements can be found in their respective directories.
